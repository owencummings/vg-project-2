Video game I am creating in GameMaker: Studio. All code and most assets are self-created.

This particular version is an early demo that still set up to be easily testable. You can navigate to some parts of the game by pressing ESC, Q, or SPACE. 

Some things look obviously wrong, but that's because its in testing, and something things aren't meant to be fixed until later.

This is a a peice of a more serious project that I am undertaking. In order to produce this project, I learned GameMaker: Studio (navigating the software and learning its unique language), pixel art, and how to compose music on an NES soundchip simulator called Famitracker. It's my baby, and my first shot at what can be considered an 'industry class' indie game (with only one dev).

In order to play the game, run the executable. You will have to imagine the structure of the game: I'm not exactly comfortable releasing the code snippets, since this project is my baby. The design isn't completely optimized for a first-time player yet. Currently fixing the gameplay cycle so that it is easier to jump into. Available... eventually.
