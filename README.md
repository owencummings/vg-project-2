Video game I created in GameMaker: Studio. All assets and code are self-created. Available soon.

This is a a peice of a more serious project that I am undertaking. In order to produce this project, I learned GameMaker: Studio (navigating the software and learning its unique language), pixel art, and how to compose music on an NES soundchip simulator called Famitracker. It's my baby, and my first shot at what can be considered an 'industry class' indie game (with only one dev).

In order to play the game, run the executable. You will have to imagine the structure of the game: I'm not exactly comfortable releasing the code snippets, since this project is my baby. The design isn't completely optimized for a first-time player yet. Currently fixing the gameplay cycle so that it is easier to jump into. Available soon.
